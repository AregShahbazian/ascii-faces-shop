State handling
    GridContainer
        handles data, currentPage, loading and lastAd
            because only GridContainer is concerned with those

    AppContainer
        handles sort
        because both GridContainer and (future) sort-selector will need sort



move static html from index.html to React components

*** HISTORY ***

configure babel
    transpiling generates code with "require"
    -> ReferenceError: require is not defined[Learn More]

    require is not in the browser, need a bundler like webpack to fix it
        https://github.com/babel/gulp-babel/issues/117 : hzoo


configure webpack
    P: webpack-dev server doesnt generate bundle in memory
    S: set output.publicPath, in HTML, get the bundle from absolute path, not relative to HTML location


Front-end and back-end server should be separated, on different servers/ports
    run webpack-dev-server (font-end) and json-server (back-end) concurrently
