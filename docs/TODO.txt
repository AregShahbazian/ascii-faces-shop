*** HISTORY ***

configure babel
    transpiling generates code with "require"
    -> ReferenceError: require is not defined[Learn More]

    require is not in the browser, need a bundler like webpack to fix it
        https://github.com/babel/gulp-babel/issues/117 : hzoo


configure webpack
    P: webpack-dev server doesnt generate bundle in memory
    S: set output.publicPath, in HTML, get the bundle from absolute path, not relative to HTML location


Front-end and back-end server should be separated, on different servers/ports
    run webpack-dev-server (font-end) and json-server (back-end) concurrently


Implement grid fetching data

State handling
    GridContainer
        handles data, currentPage, loading and lastAd
            because only GridContainer is concerned with those

    AppContainer
        handles sort
        because both GridContainer and (future) sort-selector will need sort



Listen to scroll-event in grid
    React handling events
        https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html
        doesnt say anything about scrolling

    Infinite scroll example
        https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-infinite-scroll/
        uses addEventListener
        uses window.innerHeight, window.scrollY and document.body.offsetHeight to decide when to load new data
                https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerHeight
        only fetches new data when user has reached end of the page
        only fetches new data if user already has data
        only fetches new data if not already loadings

    P: If first loaded batch doesnt fill the screen height, scrolling is impossible and no second batch will be loaded
    S: fetch data recursively from response-callback, and stop when no more data necessary


create sort select component

implement cache fetching

move static html from index.html to React components

Configure redux + redux-saga

GET_DATA saga should be cancelled when a set-sort saga starts
